# Setup step-by-step

This document gives us a quick overview how to setup ***Raspberry Pi***. For this you need the following tools such as Micro HDMI cable, USB keyboard & mouse, SD card (for RaspberryPi Zero up to 256 GB), LAN cable for the Ethernet connection. The tools mentioned are not a must, but an optimal set for the initial configuration of the RaspberryPi.

### Installation of RaspberryPi OS
First of all, one has to install RaspberryPi Imager using the following [link](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/).
